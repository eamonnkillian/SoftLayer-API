This set of program files provides a rudimentary White Label Portal to 
show how you can use the SoftLayer API to build up your own skinned

It is based on the wonderful sample API PHP scripts of Github member and 
SoftLayer API guru "underscorephil". I'd also highly recommend checking 
out these addresses for some great reference/learning materials/scripts:
